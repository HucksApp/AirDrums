      <h3>Basis</h3>
      <p>
      AirDrum uses accelerometer data to turn your phone into a drumstick,
      allowing you to play air drums that actually produce sounds. AirDrum is the creation of 
      <a href="http://github.com/eddiezane">Eddie Zaneski</a>,
      <a href="http://github.com/skodali1">Sushanth Kodali</a>, and 
      <a href="http://github.com/ilozinski">Ian Lozinski</a>. 
      The initial idea was born at HackNY '13 and was created in under 24 hours.
      Since then, the app has improved and the code is much cleaner.

      <h3>A brief history...</h3>
      <p>
      We wanted to learn while making something cool and "useful" at the same 
      time. Having recently discovered <a href="http://g.co/super">Google 
        Chrome Super-Sync Sports</a>, which lets users use their mobile device as
      a game controller, we wanted to utilize the power of websockets. We also
      wanted to experiment with hardware so we chose accelerometers to measure
      changes in velocity and the direction the phone was facing. As it turns 
      out, HTML5 has direct access to devices' accelerometer data, so instead of
      making a native iOS or Android app, it made sense to make a webapp which would scale 
      to multiple devices.

      <div class="large-centered columns">
        AirDrum was made using the following:
        <ul>
          <li>node.js</li>
          <li>express</li>
          <li>Socket.IO</li>
          <li>JavaScript AudioFX</li>
          <li>jQuery mobile</li>
        </ul>
