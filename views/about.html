          AirDrum uses accelerometer data to turn your phone into a drum stick,
          allowing you to play a virtual location aware drum set. AirDrum is the creation of 
          <a href="http://github.com/eddiezane">Eddie Zaneski</a>,
          <a href="http://github.com/ilozinski">Ian Lozinski</a>, and 
          <a href="http://github.com/skodali1">Sushanth Kodali</a>.
          The initial idea was born at the HackNY Spring '13 Student Hackathon. 
          It was created in under 24 hours and took 2nd place.

        <h3>A brief history...</h3>
        <p>
          We wanted to learn while making something cool and "useful" at the same 
          time. Having recently discovered <a href="http://g.co/super">Google 
            Chrome Super-Sync Sports</a>, which lets users use their mobile device as
          a game controller, we wanted to utilize the power of websockets. We also
          wanted to experiment with hardware so we chose accelerometers to measure
          changes in velocity and the direction the phone was facing. As it turns 
          out, HTML5 has direct access to devices' accelerometer data, so instead of
          making a native iOS or Android app, it made sense to make a webapp which would scale 
          to multiple devices. As it turns out, most Android phones do not report
          accurate accelerometer data, so iPhones deliver the best experience.
